### Allow me to introduce myself 👋

👋🏻 Hello! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Business Information Technology at BCU. I have displayed a lot of interest in the field of IT as demonstrated by my former projects and accomplishments. My motivation and eagerness to learn increases overtime and I am ready to demonstrate the skills I learned in a professional environment.

💼 Work Experience:
Currently, I am working for BCU as part of its Ambassador Scheme. More specifically, I am a figure of recruitment working hard to engage prospective students and ensure they have a wonderful time during their open & applicant taster days. Formerly, worked as an Administrator / Accounts Assistant at Dorota C Accountancy to aid in the company's transition into the 21st century.

🎓 Education:
Actively studying for my Bachelor's degree at BCU with a predicted First-Class target to aim for. Before that, I have achieved an astonishing A*AA during my T-Level (BTEC Diploma) studies.

🌍 Volunteering:
I believe that generosity is a quality we all share. I have volunteered in multiple roles around the places of education I have been in. On top of that, I personally donate my computing power on a regular basis to run simulations of protein folding aiding the development of cures for global health threats.

💾 Projects:
I undertook many projects to boost my portfolio and understand the essence of leadership related to IT projects. Recently, I have participated in the annual BCU Innovation Fest and entered with my project (FrameON) to reduce the amount of e-waste swimming in our oceans.

🎖️ Awards:
At times my work is recognised and I am rewarded for it. Recently, I have taken part in BCU's Graduate+ program which encourages students to go above and beyond to become more employable in the future. Previously, I have also been awarded the Hew Watt award by USP College which celebrates a student contributing to the social and cultural life in college.

🪪 Certifications:
It is imperative to stay abreast of new industry trends and technologies. That is the motivation necessary to understand these technologies by earning industry recognisable certifications. A few that I have on show are from Microsoft, Cisco and Python.
